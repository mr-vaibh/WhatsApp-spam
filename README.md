## Steps to send whatsapp messages on loop: -

1. Open Whatsapp web.
2. Open that person's chat you want to send messages on.
3. Press `Ctrl+Shift+J` ...OR `Cmd+Option+J` if you're rich!
4. Copy the code from [this file](https://github.com/mr-vaibh/WhatsApp-spam/blob/main/wa-spam.js).
5. Paste the code in browser console.
6. Hit enter then it will ask you to type your message and the number of times you want to send the message.

_WARNING: Don't set the number more than 4 digits, or it will crash your browser otherwise_

### NOTE for self:
there are two class names that are keep on changing, so if this code throws any error then just inspect the textbox of whatsapp and change the class name accoring to that in 7th line of code. and same for send button in 11th line.
